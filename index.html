      <p>
        This is my third attempt at creating a method for viewing a complete
        list of third-party classes for Dungeon World. It was inspired by <a
        href="http://nerdwerds.blogspot.com/2013/04/dungeon-world-resources.html"
        target="_blank">The Nerdwerd's Post</a> about Dungeon World Resources, as
        well as the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/tT40-jw0aF56DcshZHxOm_g/htmlview"
        target="_blank">Big List of Dungeon World Classes</a>, both of which are
        unfortunately fairly consistently out of date.
      </p>
      <p>
        My own first attempt was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DungeonWorld/comments/3ycr50/complete_list_of_dungeon_world_classes/"
        target="_blank">Reddit Post</a> and contributing to the Wiki for
        /r/DungeonWorld. The problem was that there was too much data for a
        thread to parse, and the Table controls for the Wiki gave very limited
        options. I could give the data to a user, but not necessarily present
        it in any meaningful way. For instance, since the descriptions were so
        long, it made the class names and authors completely squashed!
      </p>
      <p>
        Next I tried to make a Google Spreadsheet, as with the original Big List
        attempt. This, too, I dismissed, because there are no options for
        sorting or filtering. Additionally, the number of comments and large
        numbers of people viewing can also dramatically affect the performance
        of the Google Speadsheet, which I didn't want. Finally, I decided screw
        it and simply created this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have constructed it entirely with HTML, CSS, and a touch of AngularJS.
        There's a search function for filtering, individual sections can be
        expanded or collapsed, and it's presented in a way that is readable. It
        also has given me the freedom to add another section that I think is
        important that the other methods did not necessarily allow for, which is
        a walkthrough on Creating a Class.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have attempted not to link any unintentional / unsanctioned releases
        of paid work. If I've made an error, please do let me know. When possible,
        I have tried to link the thread that announced the project for ease of
        getting in touch with the author for any feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently the PDFs and Docs are hosted where the creator uploaded them
        - whether that's Dropbox or MediaFire or a purchase through
        DriveThruRPG. This means that I do not have any control over whether a
        link goes down. I am considering hosting the free copies myself, but
        am uncertain about whether that's a good idea, since it involves the
        creators having to get in touch with <i>me</i> when they want something
        removed - an idea that I am against.
      </p>
      <p>
        This list does not currently contain any Compendium Classes, nor
        anything that was exclusively posted to the Something Awful Forums.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have tried to group things together in a reasonable way while trying
        too to keep the groups from becoming too sprawling. The Magic classes
        in general are broken up in fairly arbitrary ways. I obviously have not
        read every single playbook, so if something is better suited to a
        different location, please do let me know.
